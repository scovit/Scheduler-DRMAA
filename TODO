If you are willing to help, the following are nice investments to make:

- HTCondor plugin, with DAGMan dependencies (and possibly more)
- Other plugins
- Syntax check heredocs script if executable is Perl 6
- MPI Perl 6 module to communicate between jobs, and also to share
  state
- A less deterministic Perl 6 Scheduler role in core

Might be that, at that point, the present module will become an arcaic
useless joke, but, finally, Perl concurrency functionalities can make it
the programming language for future parallel architectures.
